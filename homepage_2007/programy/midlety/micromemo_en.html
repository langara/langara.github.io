    <h2>program "Micro Memo"</h2>

    <div class="rozdzial">
        <h4>About program</h4>

        <p>I wrote this program for one course at my study. The idea is to make something similar to the "Super Memo"
		(it's a windows program), but on J2ME platform.</p>

		<p>
		First we make a database os questions and answers (like for example foreign language vocabulary) and we copy it
		to the cellphone. Then the MicroMemo program quiz us on this questions periodically. The program task is to schedule
		repetition times so it ask as about some questions exactly when we've almost forgotten the answer. This way it minimizes
		the learning time. There is no sense to repeat some question when we still remember it very good; also repeating something
		when we've forgotten it completely is too late because we have to learn it again then.
		</p>

		<p>
		How the program will know how fast we forget a particular question? It will learn that from our earlier answers.
		The user after every question try to guess the answer, and then program displays the answer, and then user
		estimate how good he had known the answer (in 1..6 scale)
		</p>

		<p>
		The benefits from using this kind of software are better explained on Memaid web page
		<a href="http://memaid.sourceforge.net/docs/repetitions.html">HERE</a> Memaid is a SuperMemo alike linux program
		</p>
		
		<p>
		More about MicroMemo is in the specification I wrote for my classes (in polish) <a href="projekt_micromemo.html">HERE</a>.
		The project is not finished yet. (although approved a long time ago.. :P). From the specification above I have done four first
		items. Besides I started to rewrite the whole code, because I want MicroMemo to work not only on cellphones, but as an applet
		and as a ordinary PC application also. So to make most of the program code common for this three platforms, I've written
		some classes (to disk access and memory card on cellphone; to display data; to get key preses from the user) for each of
		this platform separately. When I finish this rewriting, I will put the sources here. (And the working applet also)
